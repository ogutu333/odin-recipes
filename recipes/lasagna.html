			<li>1/2 cup flour</li>
			<li>4 cups milk <em>preferrably full fat</em></li>

			<li>1 1/2 cups tightly packed mozzarella cheese <em>shred yourself</em></li>
			<li>Finely chopped basil or parsley <em>for garnish</em></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<h4>Ragu</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
			<li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
			<li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
			<li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
			<li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
			<li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
			<li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable – the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering – see video). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Assemble</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
			<li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
			<li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
			<li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
			<li>Top with lasagna sheets. Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
			<li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.</li>
			<li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Pork Addition</strong> - Some traditional versions use a combination of pork and beef because pork is a more tender meat while beef provides the beefy flavour. To do this, use 250g/8oz pork and 750g/1.5lb beef. I do not (usually) do this simply because I feel like the sauce is so beautifully rich anyway (especially with the cheese sauce).</li>
			<li><strong>For non-alcoholics</strong> -  use a no alcohol red wine or more beef broth/stock.</li>
			<li><strong>Sugar</strong> - add this only if you think your sauce has a tinge of sour which can happen because not all canned tomatoes are created equal (economical tend to be more sour).</li>
			<li><strong>Cheese for sauce</strong> - Use any eating cheese that melts like cheddar, colby, Monterey jack, gruyere.<strong>SHRED YOUR OWN</strong> for silky smooth sauce, packet shredded contains anti-caking agents which can make your sauce grainy. <strong>Australia:</strong> I steer clear of tasty cheese because some brands don’t melt nicely into cheese sauce, some are oily and some go a big grainy.<strong>Mozzarella</strong> is recommended for the topping for its melting qualities, and doesn’t go greasy. Again, shred your own! It melts better – spreads better (often store bought shreds are too chunky so you don’t get good coverage).</li>
			<li><strong>Fresh vs. Dried Lasagna sheets</strong> - I like using fresh because I feel that it “melds” better with the filling and doesn’t buckle (ie go wavy), sold in the fridge section of grocery stores.</li>
			<li><strong>DRIED Lasagna Sheets</strong> - check the packet to see if it needs to be cooked before using. If it’s labelled “Instant” or “No Cook”, then you can use it without pre-cooking. If it needs to be cooked in boiling water (like pasta), follow the packet directions but regardless of what the packet says, I would recommend adding a good glug of olive oil in the water before adding the lasagna sheets (extra assurance they won’t stick together).If you use instant dried lasagna sheets, the surface probably won’t stay nice and flat, like you see in the photos, as it tends to get “waves” on the surface once cooked. No effect on flavour, it’s just visual. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If using instant dried sheets, must ensure the ragu has enough liquid to hydrate the sheets in the oven.</li>
			<li><strong>Ragu Consistency & Making Ahead</strong> - The Ragu shouldn’t be watery and there shouldn’t be an excessive amount of sauce. However, if you are using instant dried lasagna sheets (ie layer dried), you must make sure there is enough liquid to rehydrate the sheets in the oven. If you aren’t using a heavy based pot, you may find you need to add a splash of water during the cook time (heavy pot = heavy lid = clamps down better = less water evaporation). <strong>Making ahead:</strong> If you make the sauce ahead (I often do), reheat the ragu gently and you will need about 1/4 -cup water (60 ml) to loosen the sauce a touch. Add a little more if using instant dried sheets.</li>
